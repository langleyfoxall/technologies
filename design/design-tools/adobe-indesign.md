# Adobe InDesign

## Text Styles

Paragraph styles -  Create typography styles such as titles, subtitles, body text and quote text.
- If you edit a paragraph style, it will update all the text assigned to that style.


## Master Pages

Add elements to the master pages which will be displayed on all pages. An example of this is a page footer.

You can use the line tool to create 'guidelines' on the master page which will display on every child page, this is a great way to keep the design constant. Once you have finished the design, delete/hide the guidelines from the master pages.


## Package

Saving a project as a package will save all the elements into separate folders. This will allow you to easily transfer the project to another user and have the linked images and fonts.
