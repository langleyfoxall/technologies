# StyleCI

## What is StyleCI?

StyleCI is a continuous integration service that runs recommended or customised validation on your code to ensure it 
meets language-specific or internal standards. StyleCI currently supports PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, Python 
and Vue.

## Common Configurations

We have created a common set of language or framework specific yaml files that you are free to customise to suit your
project. Please ensure the configuration you decide to use is placed in your project root and uses the `.styleci.yml`
file name.

* [General PHP](configurations/general-php.md)
