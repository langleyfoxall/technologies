# Continuous Integration

## What is Continuous Integration?

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to commit code into a shared repository 
several times a day. Each commit or pull request is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect 
problems early before the code ever reaches a production environment.
